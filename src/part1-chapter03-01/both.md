# （十三）　忠実
[Faithful]

Now, as Christian went on his way, he came to a little ascent, which was cast up on purpose that pilgrims might see before them: up there, therefore, Christian went; and looking forward, he saw Faithful before him upon his journey: Then said Christian aloud, Ho, ho; so-ho; stay, and I will be your companion. At that Faithful looked behind him; to whom Christian cried again, Stay, stay, till I come up to you. But Faithful answered, No, I am upon my life, and the avenger of blood is behind me.
クリスチャンが旅路を進むと、小高い丘を見つけた。巡礼者が先を見渡すための見晴らし台だった。クリスチャンは登って、行く先を見渡した。すると前方に〈忠実〉がいた。クリスチャンは大声で呼びかけた。「おーい、おーい。待ってください。一緒に行かせてください」。忠実の返事は、しかし、こうだった。「やめてください、私はまだ生きたいのです。血の復讐が後ろから来るとは」

At this Christian was somewhat moved, and putting to all his strength, he quickly got up with Faithful, and did also overrun him; so the last was first. Then did Christian vaingloriously smile, because he had gotten the start of his brother; but not taking good heed to his feet, he suddenly stumbled and fell, and could not rise again until Faithful came up to help him.
クリスチャンはたまらなくなって、全力で駆け出した。あっという間に忠実に追いつき、それから追い越した。後の者が先になった。兄弟の先を行ったので、クリスチャンはにやりと笑った。けれども、足元をよく見ていなかったので、思いがけず転んで倒れてしまった。結局、忠実が助けに来るまで起き上がることができなかった。

Then I saw in my dream, they went very lovingly on together, and had sweet discourse of all things that had happened to them in their pilgrimage; and thus Christian began.
私が夢の中で見ていると、二人は仲睦まじく一緒に歩き、これまで旅路で起こったことを親しく話した。

CHR. My honored and well-beloved brother Faithful, I am glad that I have overtaken you, and that God has so tempered our spirits that we can walk as companions in this so pleasant a path.
クリスチャン「敬愛する兄弟、忠実さん。あなたを一度追い越したのは正解でしたね。神が私たちの霊を和ませてくださったので、こうして楽しく一緒に歩くことができました」

FAITH. I had thought, my dear friend, to have had your company quite from our town, but you did get the start of me; wherefore I was forced to come thus much of the way alone.
忠実「親愛なる友、クリスチャンさん。本当に、故郷の町から来た追手かと思いましたが、あなたは私の前を通り過ぎて行きましたね。私はここまでほとんどひとりで進むしかなかったものですから」

CHR. How long did you stay in the city of Destruction before you set out after me on your pilgrimage?
クリスチャン「〈滅びの町〉にはどれくらいおられたのですか。私の後に旅に出るまでに」

FAITH. Till I could stay no longer; for there was a great talk presently after you were gone out, that our city would, in a short time, with fire from heaven, be burnt down to the ground.
忠実「まもなく出ざるをえませんでした。あなたが出て行った後、天から火が降ってすぐにもこの町は焼け野原になる、という話を随所で聞きましたから」

CHR. What, did your neighbors talk so?
クリスチャン「そうなのですか。近所の方々がそう話したのですか」

FAITH. Yes, it was for a while in every body’s mouth.
忠実「そうです。皆が口々に言っていました」

CHR. What, and did no more of them but you come out to escape the danger?
クリスチャン「驚きです。あなただけが危難から逃れて、他の人は何もしなかったのですか」

FAITH. Though there was, as I said, a great talk thereabout, yet I do not think they did firmly believe it; for, in the heat of the discourse, I heard some of them deridingly speak of you and of your desperate journey, for so they called this your pilgrimage. But I did believe, and do still, that the end of our city will be with fire and brimstone from above; and therefore I have made my escape.
忠実「申し上げたとおり皆がその噂に夢中でしたが、誰も本当には信じていないようでした。その噂の熱にまぎれて、あなたのことやあなたの絶望的な旅のことを噂する者もいました。絶望的な旅、とそう言っていました。でも、私は信じていました。今も信じています。私たちの町が火と硫黄で滅ぼされる、と。だからこうして逃げてきました」

CHR. Did you hear no talk of neighbor Pliable?
クリスチャン「隣人の〈軟弱〉の噂は聞きましたか」

FAITH. Yes, Christian, I heard that he followed you till he came to the Slough of Despond, where, as some said, he fell in; but he would not be known to have so done: but I am sure he was soundly bedabbled with that kind of dirt.
忠実「聞きましたよ、クリスチャンさん。彼があなたについて行ったことを。〈失望の沼〉に来たとき、真偽の程はさだかではありませんが、そこに落ちてしまったとか。彼がそういう沼に落ちて溺れかけたとうかがっています」

CHR. And what said the neighbors to him?
クリスチャン「それで、近所の人たちは彼のことを何と言ったのですか」

FAITH. He hath, since his going back, been had greatly in derision, and that among all sorts of people: some do mock and despise him, and scarce will any set him on work. He is now seven times worse than if he had never gone out of the city.
忠実「戻ってから、すっかり町中の笑い者になりました。馬鹿にする人や見下す人もいました。彼に仕事をくれる人はほとんどありませんでした。彼の状態は、町を出て行かなかったよりも七倍も悪くなりました」

CHR. But why should they be so set against him, since they also despise the way that he forsook?
クリスチャン「でも、せっかく戻ってきたのにどうしてそんなに邪険に扱うのでしょうか。彼が見限った道は、町の人たちも軽蔑していたのに」

FAITH. O, they say, Hang him; he is a turncoat; he was not true to his profession! I think God has stirred up even His enemies to hiss at him, and make him a proverb, because he hath forsaken the way. Jer. 29:18,19.
忠実「ああ、彼を絞首刑にしろと町の人は言います。裏切り者だから。自分の告白に忠実でなかったから！　神は軟弱を敵に引き渡して責めるままにしておかれると思います。道を捨て彼をことわざにするために」（エレミヤ二九・一八〜一九）

CHR. Had you no talk with him before you came out?
クリスチャン「あなたは旅に出る前に彼と話しませんでしたか」

FAITH. I met him once in the streets, but he leered away on the other side, as one ashamed of what he had done; So I spake not to him.
クリスチャン「通りで一度出会いましたが、彼はうしろめたそうに目をそらしました。自分でしてしまったことを恥じているようでした。だから、一言も話しませんでした」

CHR. Well, at my first setting out I had hopes of that man; but now I fear he will perish in the overthrow of the city. For it has happened to him according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his vomit again, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire. [2 Pet. 2:22.]
クリスチャン「そうですか。旅に出た当初、私は軟弱に希望を感じていました。でもこうしてお話を聞くと、彼はあの町と一緒に滅ぼされるのではないかと恐れています。犬は自分の吐いたところに戻る、豚は洗っても泥をころげまわる、という真実のことわざのとおりになったからです」（第二ペテロ二・二二）

FAITH. These are my fears of him too; but who can hinder that which will be?
忠実「私も恐れています。が、誰が運命を変えられるでしょうか」

CHR. Well, neighbor Faithful, said Christian, let us leave him, and talk of things that more immediately concern ourselves. Tell me now what you have met with in the way as you came; for I know you have met with some things, or else it may be writ for a wonder.
クリスチャン「ええ、隣人なる忠実さん。軟弱のことはなるにまかせておきましょう。私たち自身について話しましょう。あなたの旅路で出会ったものについて教えてくれませんか。きっといろいろなことがあったでしょう。そうでなければ不思議にも書かれている？？かもしれません」

FAITH. I escaped the slough that I perceive you fell into, and got up to the gate without that danger; only I met with one whose name was Wanton, that had like to have done me mischief.
忠実「あなたが落ちたという沼は避けることができました。それで無事に門に着きました。ただ、〈浮気〉という名前の女に出会って、ちょっかいを出されました」

CHR. It was well you escaped her net: Joseph was hard put to it by her, and he escaped her as you did; but it had like to have cost him his life. Gen. 39:11-13. But what did she do to you?
クリスチャン「彼女のわなに捕らえられなくてよかったですね。ヨセフも彼女の手にかかりそうになりましたが、いのちからがら、あなたのように逃れることができました（創世記三九・一一・一三）。彼女に何をされたのですか」

FAITH. You cannot think (but that you know something) what a flattering tongue she had; she lay at me hard to turn aside with her, promising me all manner of content.
忠実「彼女がどんなふうに媚を売ったか、想像もつかないでしょうが、何となくおわかりでしょう。私のすぐそばで横になって、私にあらゆる種類の悦楽を約束しました」

CHR. Nay, she did not promise you the content of a good conscience.
クリスチャン「といっても、約束したのは良心にかなった喜びではないのでしょうね」

FAITH. You know what I mean; all carnal and fleshly content.
忠実「そうです。肉的な、物質的な悦楽です」

CHR. Thank God that you escaped her: the abhorred of the Lord shall fall into her pit. [Prov. 22:14.]
クリスチャン「神に感謝します。あなたが彼女から逃れたことを。主の忌み嫌う者だけが彼女の深い穴に落ちる（箴言二二・一四）」

FAITH. Nay, I know not whether I did wholly escape her or no.
忠実「いえ、彼女のわなから完全に逃れられたのかどうか、自分でもわからないのです」

CHR. Why, I trow you did not consent to her desires?
「どうしてでしょうか。彼女の魂胆には誘われなかったように思うのですが」

FAITH. No, not to defile myself; for I remembered an old writing that I had seen, which said, "Her steps take hold on Hell." [Prov. 5:5.] So I shut mine eyes, because I would not be bewitched with her looks. [Job 31:1.] Then she railed on me, and I went my way.
忠実「自分自身を汚すことはありませんでした。以前見た古い書物にこう書いてあったのを覚えています。『彼女の足取りは地獄につづく』（箴言五・五）。だから私は、その美貌に誘惑されないように目をつぶりました（ヨブ三一・一）。それで彼女は私をののしりました。私は先に進みました」

CHR. Did you meet with no other assault as you came?
クリスチャン「他には旅路で大変な目にあいませんでしたか」

FAITH. When I came to the foot of the hill called Difficulty, I met with a very aged man, who asked me what I was, and whither bound. I told him that I was a pilgrim, going to the Celestial City. Then said the old man, Thou lookest like an honest fellow; wilt thou be content to dwell with me for the wages that I shall give thee? Then I asked his name, and where he dwelt? He said his name was Adam the First, and that he dwelt in the town of Deceit. Eph. 4:22. I asked him then what was his work, and what the wages that he would give. He told me that his work was many delights; and his wages, that I should be his heir at last. I further asked him, what house he kept, and what other servants he had. So he told me that his house was maintained with all the dainties of the world, and that his servants were those of his own begetting. Then I asked how many children he had. He said that he had but three daughters, the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life, 1 John, 2:16; and that I should marry them if I would. Then I asked, how long time he would have me live with him; And he told me, as long as he lived himself.

CHR. Well, and what conclusion came the old man and you to at last?

FAITH. Why, at first I found myself somewhat inclinable to go with the man, for I thought he spake very fair; but looking in his forehead, as I talked with him, I saw there written, "Put off the old man with his deeds."

CHR. And how then?

FAITH. Then it came burning hot into my mind, that, whatever he said, and however he flattered, when he got me home to his house he would sell me for a slave. So I bid him forbear to talk, for I would not come near the door of his house. Then he reviled me, and told me that he would send such a one after me that should make my way bitter to my soul. So I turned to go away from him; but just as I turned myself to go thence, I felt him take hold of my flesh, and give me such a deadly twitch back, that I thought he had pulled part of me after himself: this made me cry, "O wretched man." Rom. 7:24. So I went on my way up the hill.

Now, when I had got above half-way up, I looked behind me, and saw one coming after me, swift as the wind; so he overtook me just about the place where the settle stands. CHR. Just there, said Christian, did I sit down to rest me; but being overcome with sleep, I there lost this roll out of my bosom.

FAITH. But, good brother, hear me out. So soon as the man overtook me, it was but a word and a blow; for down he knocked me, and laid me for dead. But when I was a little come to myself again I asked him wherefore he served me so. He said because of my secret inclining to Adam the First. And with that he struck me another deadly blow on the breast, and beat me down backward; so I lay at his foot as dead as before. So when I came to myself again I cried him mercy: but he said, I know not how to show mercy; and with that he knocked me down again. He had doubtless made an end of me, but that one came by and bid him forbear.

CHR. Who was that that bid him forbear?

FAITH. I did not know him at first: but as he went by, I perceived the holes in his hands and in his side: Then I concluded that he was our Lord. So I went up the hill.

CHR. That man that overtook you was Moses. He spareth none; neither knoweth he how to shew mercy to those that transgress the law.

FAITH. I know it very well; it was not the first time that he has met with me. ’Twas he that came to me when I dwelt securely at home, and that told me he would burn my house over my head if I stayed there.

CHR. But did you not see the house that stood there on the top of the hill, on the side of which Moses met you?

FAITH. Yes, and the lions too, before I came at it. But, for the lions, I think they were asleep, for it was about noon; and because I had so much of the day before me, I passed by the Porter, and came down the hill.

CHR. He told me, indeed, that he saw you go by; but I wish you had called at the house, for they would have showed you so many rarities that you would scarce have forgot them to the day of your death. But pray tell me, Did you meet nobody in the Valley of Humility?

FAITH. Yes, I met with one Discontent, who would willingly have persuaded me to go back again with him: his reason was, for that the valley was altogether without honor. He told me, moreover, that to go there was the way to disoblige all my friends, as Pride, Arrogancy, Self-Conceit, Worldly Glory, with others, who he knew, as he said, would be very much offended if I made such a fool of myself as to wade through this valley.

CHR. Well, and how did you answer him?

FAITH. I told him, that although all these that he named, might claim a kindred of me, and that rightly, (for indeed they were my relations according to the flesh,) yet since I became a pilgrim they have disowned me, and I also have rejected them; and therefore they were to me now no more than if they had never been of my lineage. I told him, moreover, that as to this valley, he had quite misrepresented the thing; for before honor is humility, and a haughty spirit before a fall. Therefore, said I, I had rather go through this valley to the honor that was so accounted by the wisest, than choose that which he esteemed most worthy of our affections.

CHR. Met you with nothing else in that valley?

FAITH. Yes, I met with Shame; but of all the men that I met with on my pilgrimage, he, I think, bears the wrong name. The other would be said nay, after a little argumentation, and somewhat else; but this bold-faced Shame would never have done.

CHR. Why, what did he say to you?

FAITH. What? why, he objected against religion itself. He said it was a pitiful, low, sneaking business for a man to mind religion. He said, that a tender conscience was an unmanly thing; and that for a man to watch over his words and ways, so as to tie up himself from that hectoring liberty that the brave spirits of the times accustomed themselves unto, would make him the ridicule of the times. He objected also, that but few of the mighty, rich, or wise, were ever of my opinion; nor any of them neither, before they were persuaded to be fools, and to be of a voluntary fondness to venture the loss of all for nobody knows what. [1 Cor. 1:26; 3:18; Phil. 3:7-9; John 7:48.] He, moreover, objected the base and low estate and condition of those that were chiefly the pilgrims of the times in which they lived; also their ignorance and want of understanding in all natural science. Yea, he did hold me to it at that rate also, about a great many more things than here I relate; as, that it was a shame to sit whining and mourning under a sermon, and a shame to come sighing and groaning home; that it was a shame to ask my neighbor forgiveness for petty faults, or to make restitution where I have taken from any. He said also, that religion made a man grow strange to the great, because of a few vices, which he called by finer names, and made him own and respect the base, because of the same religious fraternity: And is not this, said he, a shame?

CHR. And what did you say to him?

FAITH. Say? I could not tell what to say at first. Yea, he put me so to it, that my blood came up in my face; even this Shame fetched it up, and had almost beat me quite off. But at last I began to consider, that that which is highly esteemed among men, is had in abomination with God. Luke 16:15. And I thought again, this Shame tells me what men are; but he tells me nothing what God, or the word of God is. And I thought, moreover, that at the day of doom we shall not be doomed to death or life according to the hectoring spirits of the world, but according to the wisdom and law of the Highest. Therefore, thought I, what God says is best, is indeed best, though all the men in the world are against it. Seeing, then, that God prefers his religion; seeing God prefers a tender Conscience; seeing they that make themselves fools for the kingdom of heaven are wisest, and that the poor man that loveth Christ is richer than the greatest man in the world that hates him; Shame, depart, thou art an enemy to my salvation. Shall I entertain thee against my sovereign Lord? How then shall I look him in the face at his coming? Mark 8:38. Should I now be ashamed of his ways and servants, how can I expect the blessing? But indeed this Shame was a bold villain; I could scarcely shake him out of my company; yea, he would be haunting of me, and continually whispering me in the ear, with some one or other of the infirmities that attend religion. But at last I told him, that it was but in vain to attempt farther in this business; for those things that he disdained, in those did I see most glory: and so at last I got past this importunate one. And when I had shaken him off, then I began to sing,

"The trials that those men do meet withal,
That are obedient to the heavenly call,
Are manifold, and suited to the flesh,
And come, and come, and come again afresh;
That now, or some time else, we by them may
Be taken, overcome, and cast away.
O let the pilgrims, let the pilgrims then,
Be vigilant, and quit themselves like men."
CHR. I am glad, my brother, that thou didst withstand this villain so bravely; for of all, as thou sayest, I think he has the wrong name; for he is so bold as to follow us in the streets, and to attempt to put us to shame before all men; that is, to make us ashamed of that which is good. But if he was not himself audacious, he would never attempt to do as he does. But let us still resist him; for, notwithstanding all his bravadoes, he promoteth the fool, and none else. "The wise shall inherit glory," said Solomon; "but shame shall be the promotion of fools." [Prov. 3:35.]

FAITH. I think we must cry to Him for help against Shame, that would have us to be valiant for truth upon the earth.

CHR. You say true; but did you meet nobody else in that valley?

FAITH. No, not I; for I had sunshine all the rest of the way through that, and also through the Valley of the Shadow of Death.

CHR. ’Twas well for you; I am sure it fared far otherwise with me. I had for a long season, as soon almost as I entered into that valley, a dreadful combat with that foul fiend Apollyon; yea, I thought verily he would have killed me, especially when he got me down, and crushed me under him, as if he would have crushed me to pieces; for as he threw me, my sword flew out of my hand: nay, he told me he was sure of me; but I cried to God, and he heard me, and delivered me out of all my troubles. Then I entered into the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and had no light for almost half the way through it. I thought I should have been killed there over and over; but at last day brake, and the sun rose, and I went through that which was behind with far more ease and quiet.
